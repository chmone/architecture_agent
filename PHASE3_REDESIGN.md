# Phase 3 - Proper Multi-Agent Implementation 🚀

## The Problem

Initial implementation used `AgentTool` to wrap sub-agents, which caused:
```
google.genai.errors.ClientError: 400 INVALID_ARGUMENT. 
{'error': {'code': 400, 'message': 'Tool use with function calling is unsupported'}}
```

## The Solution

After analyzing Google ADK documentation, the correct pattern is to use the `sub_agents` parameter directly on parent agents, NOT `AgentTool`.

## Correct Multi-Agent Pattern

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Sub-agents as direct children
root_agent = Agent(
    name="architecture_assistant",
    instruction="...delegate to architecture_loop_agent by name...",
    sub_agents=[architecture_loop_agent]  # Direct assignment!
)

# ❌ WRONG: Using AgentTool
tools=[AgentTool(architecture_loop_agent)]  # Don't do this!
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Agent Hierarchy
```
root_agent (Agent)
└── architecture_loop_agent (LoopAgent)
    ├── analyze_requirements_agent (Agent)
    └── double_check_agent (Agent)
```

### 2. Delegation Through Instructions
The parent agent's instructions mention sub-agents by name:
```python
instruction="""...
When users need architecture design:
- Delegate to architecture_loop_agent by saying:
  'I'll have the architecture_loop_agent analyze your requirements'
..."""
```

### 3. How It Works
1. User provides requirements
2. Main agent gathers info and mentions delegating to `architecture_loop_agent`
3. Model recognizes the delegation intent
4. ADK framework automatically routes to the sub-agent
5. Loop agent runs its sub-agents iteratively
6. Results flow back to main agent

## Key Files

- **`agents_redesign.py`**: Contains the proper multi-agent implementation
- **`agent.py`**: Simple import that exports root_agent
- **`test_multiagent.py`**: Explains the pattern and differences

## Benefits

✅ Follows ADK best practices  
✅ Natural language delegation  
✅ No function calling issues  
✅ Model understands context  
✅ Cleaner architecture  

## Testing

```bash
cd /home/chmonesmith/Projects/agent_practice
adk web
```

Try: "I need architecture for a web app with 50k users, 5 developers, 6 month timeline"

Watch how the agent naturally delegates to sub-agents!
