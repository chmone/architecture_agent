*This is an example of what users receive after working with the Architecture Assistant*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Vision
PawPals connects trusted dog walkers with busy pet owners in urban areas, providing on-demand and scheduled dog walking services with real-time tracking and updates.

### Key Business Outcomes
- **Problem Solved**: Pet owners struggle to find reliable, available dog walkers
- **Target Market**: Urban professionals with dogs, starting in Seattle
- **Revenue Model**: 20% commission on each walk
- **Success Metric**: 1,000 walks/month within 6 months

### Investment Overview
- **Total Budget**: $75,000 - $100,000
- **Timeline**: 9 months to full launch
- **Team Needed**: 2 developers, 1 designer, 1 product manager
- **Break-even**: Month 8 with 50 active walkers

### Major Milestones
1. **Month 2**: MVP with basic booking (manual matching)
2. **Month 4**: Automated matching and payments
3. **Month 6**: Real-time tracking and notifications
4. **Month 9**: Ratings, reviews, and walker verification

### Key Risks & Mitigation
- **Two-sided marketplace**: Focus on recruiting walkers first
- **Trust & safety**: Partner with pet insurance provider
- **Competition**: Differentiate with hyperlocal focus

## 2. Architecture Blueprint

### System Overview (In Plain English)

Think of PawPals as having three main parts:

1. **The Mobile Apps** (what users see)
   - Dog owner app: Find walkers, book walks, track progress
   - Walker app: Accept jobs, navigate, update status
   
2. **The Brain** (backend system)
   - Matches walkers with owners
   - Handles payments securely
   - Stores all information
   - Sends notifications

3. **The Services** (external tools we use)
   - Stripe: Handles payments
   - Twilio: Sends text messages
   - Google Maps: Shows walker location
   - AWS: Hosts everything

### Technology Choices Explained

**Why These Technologies?**

üèóÔ∏è **React Native for Mobile Apps**
- Like: Building with LEGO blocks that work on both iPhone and Android
- Why: Write once, works everywhere (saves 40% development time)
- Trade-off: Slightly less smooth than native apps (acceptable for MVP)

üß† **Node.js for Backend**
- Like: JavaScript everywhere (same language as mobile)
- Why: Your developers already know it, huge community support
- Trade-off: Not the fastest option (but fast enough for 10,000 users)

üíæ **PostgreSQL for Database**
- Like: A super-organized filing cabinet
- Why: Handles relationships well (owner‚Üíbooking‚Üíwalker)
- Trade-off: Bit more complex than alternatives (worth it for data integrity)

‚òÅÔ∏è **AWS for Hosting**
- Like: Renting computers that grow with you
- Why: Start small ($100/month), scale as needed
- Trade-off: More complex than alternatives (but most flexible)

## 4. Technology Decision Record

### Decision 1: Mobile Development Approach

**Options Considered**:
1. **Native Apps** (separate iPhone/Android apps)
   - Pros: Best performance, full device features
   - Cons: 2x development time, 2x maintenance
   
2. **React Native** ‚úÖ (build once, deploy both)
   - Pros: 60% faster development, one codebase
   - Cons: 10% performance trade-off
   
3. **Web App** (mobile website)
   - Pros: Cheapest, fastest to build
   - Cons: No app store presence, limited features

**We Chose React Native Because**:
- Your budget favors efficiency over perfection
- Performance is "good enough" for dog walking
- Faster time to market crucial for validation
- Can always go native later if needed

**Revisit This Decision When**:
- You have 10,000+ daily active users
- Performance complaints exceed 5%
- You need advanced device features

---

### Decision 2: Payment Processing

**Options Considered**:
1. **Stripe** ‚úÖ
   - Cost: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
   - Why: Industry standard, excellent documentation
   
2. **Custom Solution**
   - Cost: $50,000+ to build
   - Why Not: Massive security risk, compliance nightmare

**Implementation Note**: Start with simple card payments, add wallet/bank transfers later

## 5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation Plan

### üî¥ High-Risk Areas

**1. Chicken-Egg Problem** (Need both walkers and owners)
- **Impact**: No marketplace without both sides
- **Likelihood**: 90% (happens to all marketplaces)
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Focus on recruiting walkers first
  - Offer walker incentives ($50 bonus first month)
  - Partner with dog training schools
- **Plan B**: Pivot to B2B (dog daycare staff augmentation)

**2. Trust & Safety Incidents**
- **Impact**: One bad incident could kill the business
- **Likelihood**: 20% in first year
- **Mitigation**:
  - Background checks (add $15/walker cost)
  - Liability insurance requirement
  - Clear incident response plan
  - 24/7 emergency hotline
- **Plan B**: Partner with established pet care company

### üü° Medium Risks

**3. Technical Scaling Issues**
- **Impact**: App crashes during peak times
- **Likelihood**: 50% after 5,000 users
- **Mitigation**:
  - Load testing at each phase
  - Auto-scaling infrastructure
  - Performance monitoring alerts

**4. Competitor Response**
- **Impact**: Rover enters your market
- **Likelihood**: 40% if successful
- **Mitigation**:
  - Build strong local community
  - Focus on niche (e.g., special needs dogs)
  - Consider acquisition talks early
