# Exit Criteria Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented clear exit criteria and scope boundaries for all sub-agents to prevent scope creep. The reality check agent (and others) will no longer continue working beyond their intended purpose.

## Changes Made

### 1. Agent Prompt Updates

Updated ALL agent prompts with four new sections:

#### A. YOUR ONLY JOB
- Single, clear statement of agent's purpose
- Example: "Discover and document the user's business requirements through conversation. Nothing more."

#### B. CRITICAL BOUNDARIES - YOU MUST NEVER
- Explicit list of forbidden actions
- Prevents agents from venturing into other domains
- Example boundaries for requirements agent:
  - Design technical solutions or architecture
  - Recommend specific technologies
  - Start implementation planning
  - Write code

#### C. COMPLETION CRITERIA - YOU ARE DONE WHEN
- Clear signals that indicate job completion
- Recognition phrases from users
- Example phrases:
  - "Yes, that's exactly right"
  - "I understand the challenges"
  - "That makes sense"
  - "Thanks for explaining"

#### D. MANDATORY HANDOFF MESSAGE
- Exact message agents must send when complete
- Always includes "Let me hand you back to the main assistant"
- Triggers orchestrator to take control

### 2. Orchestrator Enhancements

#### A. Agent Handoff Recognition
New section that instructs orchestrator to:
- Immediately recognize handoff messages
- Take control of conversation
- Thank the agent
- Summarize accomplishments
- Ask for user feedback

#### B. Agent Boundary Enforcement
When delegating, orchestrator now:
- Sets clear expectations about LIMITED scope
- Explicitly tells agents to ONLY do their job
- Reminds agents to hand back control

Example: "I'll have the project_reality_check_agent assess feasibility. They'll ONLY provide an assessment, then hand back to me."

#### C. Enhanced Completion Examples
Added detailed examples for handling each agent's completion with proper handoff dialogue.

### 3. Updated Agents

1. **requirements_discovery_agent**
   - Exit: When user confirms requirements are captured
   - Handoff: "Your vision is now clearly documented..."

2. **project_reality_check_agent**
   - Exit: When user acknowledges understanding challenges
   - Handoff: "You now have a realistic understanding..."

3. **tradeoff_educator_agent**
   - Exit: When user indicates understanding
   - Behavior: Calls exit_loop() immediately

4. **implementation_roadmap_agent**
   - Exit: When roadmap is delivered and acknowledged
   - Handoff: "You now have a clear, phased plan..."

5. **analyze_requirements_agent**
   - Exit: When architecture design is complete
   - Note: Waits for validation from double_check_agent

### 4. Documentation Created

- `AGENT_EXIT_CRITERIA.md` - Comprehensive guide to the exit criteria system

## Testing the Implementation

The system now enforces:
1. Agents stop when users acknowledge completion
2. No agent ventures into another's domain
3. Smooth handoffs back to orchestrator
4. Clear conversation flow without pauses

## Example Flow

```
User: "I want to build an app like Uber for dogs"
Orchestrator: "I'll have requirements_discovery_agent explore your idea. They'll ONLY focus on understanding your needs."

[Requirements agent works]

User: "Yes, that captures it perfectly!"
Requirements Agent: "Excellent! I've completed discovering your requirements. Let me hand you back to the main assistant..."

Orchestrator: "Thank you! Great work capturing those requirements. So [User], we now have a clear vision. Shall we assess feasibility?"

[Reality check agent works]

User: "I understand the challenges now."
Reality Agent: "Great! I've completed the feasibility assessment. Let me hand you back to the main assistant..."

Orchestrator: "Thanks for that thorough reality check! You now understand the key challenges. Would you like an implementation roadmap?"
```

## Key Benefits

1. **No More Scope Creep**: Agents stay strictly within boundaries
2. **Predictable Behavior**: Clear completion patterns
3. **Smooth Experience**: No confusion about control
4. **Better Orchestration**: Central control maintained
