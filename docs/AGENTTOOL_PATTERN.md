# AgentTool Pattern Implementation - Architecture Assistant

## Overview

The AgentTool pattern solves the search delegation problem by converting the search_agent into a tool that other agents can use directly, rather than requiring orchestrator-level delegation.

## Problem Solved

Previously, when sub-agents needed to search:
1. They would say "I need to research X"
2. Root orchestrator would see this and delegate to search_agent
3. This indirect delegation was causing issues with architecture agents

## Solution: AgentTool Pattern

We converted search_agent into an AgentTool that sub-agents can use directly:

```python
from google.adk.tools import AgentTool

# Create the search agent as before
search_agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    name="search_agent",
    description="Performs web searches for all other agents in the system",
    instruction=SEARCH_AGENT_PROMPT,
    tools=[google_search]  # ONLY agent with google_search tool
)

# Convert to AgentTool
search_agent_tool = AgentTool(agent=search_agent)

# Now other agents can use it directly
requirements_discovery_agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    name="requirements_discovery_agent",
    description="Helps users discover their true requirements through conversation",
    instruction=REQUIREMENTS_DISCOVERY_PROMPT,
    tools=[search_agent_tool]  # Can use search_agent directly!
)
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Agents with Search Capability

The following agents now have `search_agent_tool` in their tools:
- `requirements_discovery_agent` - For market research and similar businesses
- `project_reality_check_agent` - For feasibility research and case studies
- `implementation_roadmap_agent` - For timeline and cost research
- `analyze_requirements_agent` - For best practices and patterns

### 2. Agents without Search Capability

These agents don't need search capabilities:
- `tradeoff_educator_agent` - Uses existing knowledge to explain
- `clarification_agent` - Only checks understanding
- `double_check_agent` - Only validates architecture

### 3. Root Orchestrator Changes

The root orchestrator no longer:
- Includes search_agent in its sub_agents list
- Handles search delegation requests
- Mentions search_agent in its prompt

### 4. Updated Agent Prompts

Agent prompts now say:
```
Use the search_agent tool directly to get current information from the web.
```

Instead of:
```
Say: "I need to research [topic]" and the system will provide results.
```

## Architecture After Implementation

```
root_agent (NO TOOLS - orchestrator only)
├── requirements_discovery_agent (has search_agent_tool)
├── project_reality_check_agent (has search_agent_tool)
├── education_loop_agent (LoopAgent)
│   ├── tradeoff_educator_agent (exit_loop only)
│   └── clarification_agent (exit_loop only)
├── architecture_loop_agent (LoopAgent)
│   ├── analyze_requirements_agent (has search_agent_tool)
│   └── double_check_agent (exit_loop only)
└── implementation_roadmap_agent (has search_agent_tool)

Note: search_agent exists as an AgentTool, not as a sub_agent
```

## Benefits

1. **Direct Access**: Agents can search immediately without delegation
2. **Better Performance**: No round-trip through orchestrator
3. **Cleaner Architecture**: Search is a tool, not an agent to coordinate
4. **Fixes Architecture Agent Issue**: Architecture agents can now search directly
5. **Maintains Constraint**: Still only ONE agent (search_agent) has google_search

## Testing the Implementation

1. Run `adk web` from parent directory
2. Select 'architecture_assistant'
3. Test queries that require research:
   - "What are common patterns for marketplace apps?"
   - "How much does it typically cost to build an MVP?"
   - "What regulations exist for healthcare apps?"

4. Verify that:
   - Agents can search directly without saying "I need to research"
   - No "Tool use with function calling" errors occur
   - Search results are integrated smoothly into responses

## Key Takeaways

- AgentTool allows agents to use other agents as tools
- This pattern is perfect for shared services like search
- It maintains the constraint of only one agent having google_search
- It simplifies the orchestration logic significantly
