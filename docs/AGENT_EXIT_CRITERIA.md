# Agent Exit Criteria and Scope Boundaries

## Problem Solved

Sub-agents were experiencing scope creep - continuing to work beyond their intended purpose. For example, the reality check agent would start helping write code after the user acknowledged understanding the assessment.

## Solution: Clear Exit Criteria System

We implemented a three-part solution to ensure agents stay within their boundaries:

1. **Agent-Level Controls**: Each agent has explicit boundaries and exit criteria
2. **Orchestrator Controls**: The orchestrator sets expectations and handles handoffs
3. **System-Level Recognition**: Clear handoff patterns that trigger control transfer

## Agent Exit Criteria Implementation

### Structure for Each Agent

Every agent prompt now includes:

1. **YOUR ONLY JOB** - Single, clear purpose
2. **CRITICAL BOUNDARIES - YOU MUST NEVER** - Explicit list of forbidden actions
3. **COMPLETION CRITERIA - YOU ARE DONE WHEN** - Clear signals to stop
4. **MANDATORY HANDOFF MESSAGE** - Exact message to send when complete

### Example: Requirements Discovery Agent

```
## YOUR ONLY JOB
Discover and document the user's business requirements through conversation. Nothing more.

## CRITICAL BOUNDARIES - YOU MUST NEVER:
- Design technical solutions or architecture
- Recommend specific technologies or frameworks
- Estimate costs or timelines in detail
- Start implementation planning
- Write any code or technical specifications
- Give feasibility assessments
- Make technical decisions

## COMPLETION CRITERIA - YOU ARE DONE WHEN:
1. User confirms the requirements capture their vision correctly
2. User says phrases like:
   - "Yes, that's exactly right"
   - "That captures it perfectly"
   - "You've got it"
   - "That's my vision"
   - "Nothing to add"
   - "Looks good"

## MANDATORY HANDOFF MESSAGE
When the user confirms requirements are complete, you MUST respond with:
"Excellent! I've completed discovering your requirements. Your vision is now clearly documented. Let me hand you back to the main assistant who can help with the next steps in your journey."
```

## Orchestrator Handoff Handling

The root orchestrator now includes:

### 1. Agent Handoff Recognition
When an agent sends their mandatory handoff message, the orchestrator:
- Immediately takes control
- Thanks the agent
- Summarizes accomplishments
- Asks for user feedback
- Offers next steps

### 2. Agent Boundary Enforcement
When delegating, the orchestrator:
- Sets clear expectations about LIMITED scope
- Tells agents to ONLY do their specific job
- Reminds them to hand back control when done

Example: "I'll have the project_reality_check_agent assess feasibility. They'll ONLY provide an assessment, then hand back to me."

### 3. Proper Completion Handling
After each agent completes:
```
Agent: "[Mandatory handoff message]"
Orchestrator: "Thank you! [Summary of what was done]. [User], [ask for feedback]. [Offer next steps]"
```

## Complete Agent Exit Criteria

### requirements_discovery_agent
- **Purpose**: Discover requirements ONLY
- **Complete when**: User confirms requirements captured correctly
- **Never**: Design solutions, recommend tech, estimate costs

### project_reality_check_agent
- **Purpose**: Assess feasibility ONLY
- **Complete when**: User acknowledges understanding challenges
- **Never**: Start implementation, write code, design architecture

### tradeoff_educator_agent
- **Purpose**: Explain technical concepts ONLY
- **Complete when**: User indicates understanding
- **Never**: Make decisions for user, start implementing

### implementation_roadmap_agent
- **Purpose**: Create actionable plan ONLY
- **Complete when**: User acknowledges the roadmap
- **Never**: Start implementation, write code

### analyze_requirements_agent
- **Purpose**: Design technical architecture ONLY
- **Complete when**: Architecture design delivered for validation
- **Never**: Implement code, create detailed specs

## Testing the Exit Criteria

To verify agents properly exit:

1. **Acknowledgment Test**: When user says "I understand" or "got it", agent should handoff
2. **Scope Test**: Agent should never venture into another agent's domain
3. **Handoff Test**: Agent should use exact handoff message
4. **Orchestrator Test**: Orchestrator should immediately take control after handoff

## Benefits

1. **No Scope Creep**: Agents stay within their defined boundaries
2. **Smooth Handoffs**: Clear control transfer back to orchestrator
3. **Better User Experience**: No confusion about who's in control
4. **Predictable Behavior**: Agents always behave consistently

## Key Principles

1. **Single Purpose**: Each agent has ONE job
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit "MUST NEVER" lists
3. **Recognition Patterns**: Specific phrases trigger completion
4. **Mandatory Handoffs**: Non-negotiable handoff protocol
5. **Orchestrator Control**: Central coordination maintained
