# Architecture Assistant Fixes Summary V2

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Education Loop Agent Error (KEPT)
**Problem**: LoopAgent was trying to use the same agent instance twice, causing "Agent already has a parent" error.

**Solution**: Created a proper education loop with two different agents:
- `tradeoff_educator_agent`: Explains technical concepts with analogies
- `clarification_agent`: Checks understanding and decides whether to continue or exit

### 2. ✅ Function Calling Error (NEW SOLUTION)
**Problem**: "Tool use with function calling is unsupported" error when multiple agents have google_search tool.

**Root Cause**: Gemini only supports one built-in tool (like google_search) at a time across the entire system.

**Solution**: Implemented centralized search delegation pattern:
1. Created dedicated `search_agent` - ONLY agent with google_search tool
2. Removed google_search from ALL other agents
3. Updated agent prompts to request searches using natural language
4. Added search_agent to root orchestrator's sub_agents
5. Updated root prompt to handle search delegation

## New Architecture

```
root_agent (NO TOOLS - orchestrator only)
├── search_agent (ONLY agent with google_search tool) ← NEW
├── requirements_discovery_agent (no tools)
├── project_reality_check_agent (no tools)
├── education_loop_agent (LoopAgent)
│   ├── tradeoff_educator_agent (exit_loop only)
│   └── clarification_agent (exit_loop only)
├── architecture_loop_agent (LoopAgent)
│   ├── analyze_requirements_agent (no tools)
│   └── double_check_agent (exit_loop only)
└── implementation_roadmap_agent (no tools)
```

## Search Delegation Pattern

### How It Works
1. Agent needs information: "I need to research market size for dog walking apps"
2. Root agent recognizes search request
3. Root delegates to search_agent: "I'll have the search_agent look that up"
4. Search agent performs search and returns results
5. Original agent continues with the information

### Key Changes to Agent Prompts
```python
# OLD: Direct search
"Use Google Search to research similar businesses..."

# NEW: Request search
"When you need to research similar businesses...
Say: 'I need to research [topic]. Let me get that information.'"
```

## Testing Instructions

1. Run `adk web` from parent directory
2. Select 'architecture_assistant'
3. Test with queries requiring research:
   - "I want to build a marketplace app" (requires market research)
   - "What's the typical cost for building an MVP?" (requires cost research)
   - "Are there regulations for healthcare apps?" (requires regulatory research)

## What to Verify

✅ No "Tool use with function calling" errors
✅ Agents successfully request and receive search results
✅ Education loop works for iterative explanations
✅ Natural conversation flow maintained
✅ Users get valuable insights from searches

## Key Takeaways

1. **ADK Constraint**: Only ONE agent can have built-in tools like google_search
2. **Delegation Pattern**: Use natural language requests, not direct tool usage
3. **Central Services**: Create dedicated agents for shared functionality
4. **Clear Documentation**: This constraint must be well-documented for maintainers
