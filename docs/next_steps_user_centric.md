   - Roadmap visualizer
   - Risk assessment builder

2. Customization Engine
   - Adapt language to user's industry
   - Scale complexity to project size
   - Include relevant examples

3. Export Options
   - PDF package generation
   - Markdown for developers
   - Slide deck for stakeholders

**Deliverable**: Complete package generation system

### Phase 7: Learning & Progress Tracking (Week 7-8)

**Goal**: Help users grow their technical understanding

**Features**:
1. Knowledge Assessment
   - Initial skill evaluation
   - Progress tracking
   - Concept mastery indicators

2. Personalized Learning Paths
   - Role-based curricula
   - Just-in-time learning
   - External resource curation

3. Achievement System
   - Milestone celebrations
   - Confidence building
   - Knowledge badges

**Deliverable**: Integrated learning management system

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Refactor Current Structure
```python
# Move from:
agents/
├── specialists/
│   ├── security.py       # DELETE
│   ├── scalability.py    # DELETE
│   └── cost.py          # DELETE

# To:
agents/
├── discovery/
│   ├── requirements_discovery.py
│   └── reality_check.py
├── education/
│   ├── tradeoff_educator.py
│   └── concept_explainer.py
├── planning/
│   ├── implementation_roadmap.py
│   └── milestone_tracker.py
```

### Step 2: Create Conversation Framework
```python
# utils/conversation.py
class ConversationManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.context = {}
        self.user_level = "beginner"
        self.conversation_history = []
    
    def update_context(self, key, value):
        """Track important information across agents"""
        
    def get_next_question(self, topic):
        """Progressive questioning logic"""
        
    def should_educate(self, concept):
        """Determine if explanation needed"""
```

### Step 3: Build Template System
```python
# templates/deliverables.py
class DeliverableGenerator:
    def generate_executive_summary(self, context):
        """Create business-friendly summary"""
        
    def generate_technical_spec(self, context):
        """Developer-ready specifications"""
        
    def generate_roadmap(self, context):
        """Visual milestone plan"""
```

## Testing Strategy

### User Testing Scenarios

1. **Complete Beginner**
   - "I have an idea for an app"
   - Success: Receives clear, actionable plan without confusion

2. **Business Person with Some Tech**
   - "I want to build a SaaS platform"
   - Success: Learns key concepts while getting specific guidance

3. **Technical Person, New to Architecture**
   - "How do I scale my side project?"
   - Success: Gets architectural guidance at appropriate level

### Quality Metrics

**Conversation Quality**:
- No technical jargon in responses
- Questions build on previous answers
- User never feels lost

**Education Effectiveness**:
- User can explain their architecture to others
- Confident in technical decisions
- Knows what questions to ask developers

**Deliverable Usefulness**:
- Can hand to developer and start building
- Stakeholders understand the plan
- Clear next steps and timelines

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Over-Simplification
**Mitigation**: Progressive complexity disclosure

### Risk: Incorrect Analogies
**Mitigation**: Test analogies with target users

### Risk: Scope Creep
**Mitigation**: Clear phase boundaries and goals

### Risk: Losing Technical Accuracy
**Mitigation**: Technical review of all educational content

## Success Vision

Three months from now, a non-technical founder can:

1. Start with just an idea
2. Have a conversation that feels natural and helpful
3. Learn what they need to know (not everything)
4. Make informed technical decisions
5. Receive a complete action plan
6. Feel confident talking to developers
7. Successfully build their MVP

The architecture assistant becomes not just a tool, but a trusted advisor on their entrepreneurial journey.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. [ ] Review and approve this plan
2. [ ] Begin implementing Requirements Discovery Agent
3. [ ] Create first conversation flow diagram
4. [ ] Test with one real non-technical user
5. [ ] Iterate based on feedback

## Remember

We're not building a system that impresses developers.  
We're building a system that empowers dreamers to become builders.

The measure of success is not the elegance of the architecture,  
but the success of the users who trust us to guide them.
